# Durable Objects Integration - Summary

## What was added:

### 1. **Durable Object Class** (`src/conversation.ts`)
- Created `ConversationHistory` Durable Object class
- Stores persistent conversation messages with timestamps
- Supports:
  - `GET /history` - Retrieve conversation history
  - `POST /add` - Add a message to history
  - `POST /clear` - Clear all messages

### 2. **Wrangler Configuration** (`wrangler.jsonc`)
- Added Durable Objects binding: `CONVERSATION_HISTORY`
- Configured migration for the `ConversationHistory` class
- Binds the Durable Object to the Worker

### 3. **Worker Integration** (`src/index.ts`)
- Exported the `ConversationHistory` Durable Object
- Added three new API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/history?sessionId=xxx` - Load conversation from DO
  - `POST /api/save-message` - Save message to DO
  - `POST /api/clear-history` - Clear conversation in DO

### 4. **Frontend Updates** (`src/index.ts` - HTML/JS)
- Added session ID generation and localStorage persistence
- Auto-loads conversation history on page load
- Auto-saves every message to Durable Object
- Reset button now clears both client and server history

## How it works:

1. **Session Management**: Each user gets a unique `sessionId` stored in localStorage
2. **Persistent Storage**: All messages are stored in a Durable Object keyed by sessionId
3. **Auto-sync**: Messages are automatically saved to the DO after being added
4. **Page Refresh**: Conversation history persists across page refreshes
5. **Multi-device**: Same sessionId = same conversation (can be extended for multi-device)

## Benefits:

✅ **Persistent State** - Conversations survive page refreshes and browser restarts  
✅ **Durable Objects** - Satisfies the "Workflow/coordination" requirement  
✅ **Memory/State** - Fully persistent server-side state storage  
✅ **Scalable** - Each session gets its own Durable Object instance  
✅ **Assignment-Ready** - Now meets all 4 requirements completely!

## Testing:

1. Start the dev server: `wrangler dev`
2. Chat with the AI in multiple languages
3. Refresh the page - your conversation history should persist!
4. Click "Reset Chat" to clear everything
5. Check that messages are being saved to Durable Objects

## Next Steps (Optional):

- Add user authentication for true multi-device sync
- Implement conversation sharing via unique URLs
- Add analytics/metrics to Durable Objects
- Implement message search/filtering
